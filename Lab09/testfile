 Lab 17 Summary
     We are able to quantify the relationship between the variables we looked at in the second lab where we talked and discussed the Cairo conference. We classified the countries by continent and we saw that the birth rates for Europe were low and Africa’s birth rates were high. With this lab, we are going to do the cross-tabulation technique to get a contingency table for the high and low rates for each continent. We will use a bar chart in this lab to compare and show the differences. We use a simple random sample in this lab for the birth rates of 50 countries.
     	We can now use inferential statistics with the results of a random sample to make a conclusion about the relationship between birth rate and continent. Such as the last two labs, we usually limit the errors to 5%. We will continue to use the 5% for this lab on Chi-Square. We are using the test of homogeneity where we are comparing the proportion of high birth rates for two or more populations. We have more than two populations to dissect so we are going to use the Chi-Square hypothesis test. The z test only allows two population proportions. The Chi-Square test statistic is going to be the difference between the observed counts of low and high birth rates and the expected counts of low and high birth rates given that the null hypothesis is true. The formula is as follows: χ^2=∑(o_i-e_i )^2/e_i .
	Centurion gives us the expected values, finds the difference, and divides by the expected values for each of the cells in the contingency table. It also gives us the totals of those calculations and tells us how often we should get such a result when and if the null hypothesis is true. We get a reported p-value and it is significant if the reported p-value is below 5%. If we end up rejecting at 5%, then we are making a type 1 error which is when we reject a true null hypothesis. One of the assumptions that we made in the Chi-Square hypothesis test is that we want to get more than 5 or more in each cell. If we do not meet that assumption then it is possible that our conclusion to reject the null hypothesis contains a greater error than the 5% we used when rejecting H0, or that we FTR because we lost some power in the test we did with a larger type II error than would have been true with meeting the assumptions.
	If the sample size is fairly large, the Chi-Square test is able to sustain a great power even when violating the assumption. If we get more than 20% of our expected values less than 5, then we continue to combine the counts for two or more classes. When we do the cross tabulation on Centurion, it gives us percentages but with the Chi-Square test statistic, we want counts. To get the expected count, we use the formula as follows: ei = ((row total)(column total))/(grand total).   We have to redo the calculations with the combined counts for the classes so that we meet the two assumptions of the Chi-Square test. We still reject at 5% using the Chi-Square test with the combined cell counts. We now compare the two p-values of the two Chi-Square test we did. We then also look at the calculations with 1%. We did a test where we did not meet the assumptions of the hypothesis test, we fail to reject the null hypothesis because we got a reported p-value at 3.62%. Those results are correct and what we expected to get because we knew that we violated the assumptions of the Chi-Square hypothesis test.
