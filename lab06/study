we need to know the difference between absolute and relative path.
   If there is a file that has a / is an absolute path because it points to the file
   no matter what the pwd is.

   If there is no slash or "foo or ../foo" then it is a relative path because it is
   relative to the pwd we are in.

   Know the difference between cd ./foo and cd foo

Go over the feed back on the labs.
   mkdir -p
   cp -i -n


Lab03 - feedback - not happy with results

      Expect to know the chmod numbers.
      symbolic vs outal - column 2
      attributes/notation/chmod the notation is octal

Know how to set properties chmod 755 for the file vs the directory because you cannot change
into a file if the directory is not able to be ran.
